A CSS loader animation is a visual indicator used to inform users that a process is ongoing, such as data loading or processing. The key components and concepts include:

HTML Structure:

A basic HTML element, usually a div, serves as the container for the loader.
CSS Styling:

The loader is styled using CSS to create the visual effect. Common styles include:
Borders: Often, the loader is represented as a circle with borders. Different border colors or thicknesses can create a visual effect of movement.
Border Radius: Setting this to 50% makes the element circular.
Dimensions: Fixed width and height to define the size of the loader.
CSS Animation:

Keyframes: CSS animations are defined using @keyframes. This allows you to describe the changes in styles at various points in the animation sequence (e.g., from 0% to 100%).
Animation Properties: Properties like animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, and animation-iteration-count control the animation's behavior, duration, and repetition.
Transformations:

Rotate: A common transformation for loaders is rotation (transform: rotate(angle)). This creates a spinning effect, which is visually effective for indicating ongoing processes.
Infinite Loop:

Loaders typically use an infinite loop (animation-iteration-count: infinite) to keep the animation running as long as the process is ongoing.
Key Concepts:
Visual Feedback: Loaders provide visual feedback to users, improving user experience by indicating that their action is being processed.
CSS Animation: Utilizes CSS animations to create smooth, performant visual effects without the need for JavaScript.
Transform and Keyframes: Core CSS techniques used to animate elements, providing the flexibility to create various loader styles.
In essence, a CSS loader animation leverages basic HTML for structure and CSS for styling and animation to create a visually appealing indicator of ongoing processes.
